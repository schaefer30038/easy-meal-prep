# iteration1
To be able to run the app, we use Android Studio.
First, upload the iteration1 file to the AndroidStudioProjects directory.
Then open up Android Studio and open the working directory of iteration 1.
Using either your own Android device or emulator within the IDE, run the application, and then the app should run.
