# EZ Meal Prep
To be able to run the app, we use Android Studio.

If the user doesn't want to install Android Studio they can install the app directly on their android device. The android device has to allow installing unknown apps. The direction for enabling this feature can be found online, [here](https://www.lifewire.com/install-apk-on-android-4177185) is one such source we found. The apk file can be found here in the repo [APK file](Easy%20Meal%20Prep.apk). After installing the user can run the app by opening the app.


## Android Studio Direction
First, upload the easy-meal-prep file to the AndroidStudioProjects directory.
Then open up Android Studio and open the working directory of easy-meal-prep.
Using either your own Android device or emulator within the IDE, run the application, and then the app should run.
